    "    The UEFA European Football Championship, also known as the Euros, is a tournament held by UEFA every four years in which selection of European countries compete. There are also similar competitions for other continents such as the CONCACAF Gold Cup which is held for North American international teams. Although there are many different continental competitions, the Euros are by far the most popular because the majority of the worlds best players play for European teams. Although this competition is called the 2020 Euros, it is being held in 2021 because of COVID. Currently the qualifiers for the tournment have already been played and the 24 teams that go into the tournament have already been decided. Later on you will see a list of these teams. The current reigning champions are Portugal.\n",

During the group stage each team will play every other team twice, once at home and once away from home. Each team gets 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss. At the end of the group stage, the top 2 teams move on to the next round and play in a standard knockout style tournament.\n",

    "So first things first, if you are new to the realm of fantasy football don't worry. Here's the basics of how fantasy works... in most fantasy football formats (yes there are multiple fantasy games for the same sporting event, as you could imagine one simply wouldn't be enough for the fantasy community) you are given a certain amount of budget at the start of the season to build your squad. Using that budget, you pick a set of 15 or so players (a starting 11 plus bench players) from the entire selection of players available. Each player in the game is given a particular price tag, with the \"better\"/more high profile players costing more than other players. Once you have picked your initial team, you pick a starting 11 for each matchweek/gameweek, during which the players in your 11 rack up points based on how will they perform (in real life) during that week. Points are usually awarded for every goal scored, every assist, clean sheets, minutes played, saves (for goalkeepers), etc. Come the end of the season, the more total points you accumulate the higher up you are in the leaderboard (whether that's worldwide, or simply a mini league you and your colleagues at work/school started). Note that there are more involved aspects of fantasy such as weekly transfers, captaincy, chips like wildcard and benchboost, etc. but we are not going to dive into these aspects as they are not necessary to get you started (and in fact, have no effect on the area of focus for this guide, which will be the initial team selection).\n",

    "Okay, so now that you know the basics of fantasy, let's talk about how it relates to the Euros! As you might imagine, just as there are fantasy games for the annual football leagues played across the world (like the English Premier League, the German Bundesliga, the Italian Serie A, etc.), there are also fantasy games for singular tournaments such as the World Cup and the Euros, which take place every four years (Here's the official fantasy game sponsored by UEFA, you can started creating your team from <a href=\"https://gaming.uefa.com/en/uefaeuro2020fantasyfootball/create-team\">here</a>). Since the tournament duration is only a month or two, the fantasy game will only run for the duration of the tournament. In fantasy games involving international tournaments, the game is usually split into two phases. One phase for the group stages and one phase for the knockout rounds. In other words, you get to choose an initial team to play during the group stage portion of the tournament (where each team is guaranteed to play 3 games against the other teams in their group), and then get to select a completely new squad for the knockout rounds, choosing players from the teams that are still alive in the tournament. \n",

This is due to the fact that the group stages are the first phase of the Euro Fantasy game, and more importantly, since all we know are the teams who have qualified for the tournament, we can't make selections for the knockout stages as there is always the possibility that the players we pick are on teams that do not advance to the knockout stages (and hence will earn no points). Additionally, we will not be focusing on finding budget value players (players that are underpriced in the game when compared to their points potential) and will instead be focusing on picking the \"best\" fantasy assets on the pure basis of their form and potential for scoring loads of points (regardless of how expensive they are). In other words, this guide will be our selection of who we think are going to be the players who score the most points overall, and therefore serving as the foundational set of players you can build your team around (you think of it as the core players who will make up the largest chunk of your budget, but consequently expected to produce the most fantasy returns).\n",

    "So first things first. We need to figure out what subset of players we want to focus on during our search. Our options are forwards, midfielders, defenders, and goalkeepers. At first glance, all these options seem appealing... and they are. After all, we see players from each of these categories score extremely well in fantasy every year. That being said, one category stands out above all else: forwards. Regardless of the fantasy format, forwards consistently are the players who score the most fantasy points. As a consequence of this, they tend to be the most expensive fantasy assets, which does eat into your total budget quite a bit. However, as we previously mentioned, since this search is meant to be for the best fantasy players (in terms of points potential), a high price will not negatively impact a player's fantasy outlook. Additionally, as we are using data science, there is no guarantee that our predictions we be correct, no matter the probabilities or how promising the data looks. As a result of this we want to focus on the players whose source of points comes from areas of the game which are the \"easiest\" to predict (or less \"difficult\" to predict). The main source of points for attacking players (forwards and midfielders) come from goals and assists. The main source of points for defensive players (defenders and goalkeepers) come from clean sheets (aka a shutout, where the opposing team fails to score). Due to the unpredictability of clean sheets (a team only needs to concede once in order to lose their clean sheet, it could be from an improbable goal or occur in the 90th minute after the team didn't concede for almost the entirety of the game), we will narrow our search to just the attacking players.\n",

    "Whether you or a soccer fan or not, we all know one thing: attackers score goals. As you might imagine, this mantra is very relevant when thinking about what attackers to select for your fantasy team. No matter what version of a fantasy game you play, the idea that \"the more goals your attackers score the better of your fantasy team will be\" holds true. After all, goals are the bread and butter of attackers. So with this in mind, let's zoom our lens in on the topscorers of each team. More specifically, the topscorers for each team during Euro Qualifiers (you guessed it... it's the set of games teams had to play in order to qualify for the tournament). Our hypothesis is that the topscorers for each team during the qualifiers are more likely to score during the group stages of the actual tournament. Let's see if this is the case by taking a look at the Euro's of previous years, and see what percentage of top scorers actually ended up scoring at least 1 goal in the group stages of the actual tournament.\n",

    "Let's start by focusing on Euro 2012, in particular, and see what results we get. We can't do any data science without getting the data first, so let's scrape the internet for information on how each team did during qualifying, as well as the topscorers for each team in the matches played, and collect that into pandas dataframes. Notice that here, we are using a different method to acquire the data needed to for the exploration and analysis. Rather than reading a csv with the data into a pandas dataframe, we are scraping the html of websites to gather the information we need (during this guide, we will be using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_PageWikipedia\">Wikipedia</a> as our main source of information, so will be scraping mostly from there). This will be done using the library 'BeautifulSoup' (you can check out the documentation <a href=\"https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/\">here</a>) and the python's 'requests' library to get the html of the website (check it our <a href=\"https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/\">here</a>)). At the end of the tutorial, we will be discussing the pros and cons of the two different approaches used to access the data needed to create the intial pandas dataframe.\n",

    "Let's try a create model that given a set of attributes can best predict based on a player's performance in the qualifiers whether or not they will score at least one goal in the group stages. There are two things that we must do before we begin our process of creating the model. Number one, we need to gather a larger amount of data (because currently our sample size of topscorers is too small) so that we can feel comfortable collecting a model that will actually be a good predictor of future Euros. One immediate way we can expand our dataset size is by considering all the scorers in the qualifiers, instead of just the topscorers. From the previous analysis conducted, we see that limiting our scope to just top goalscorers was not as effective and successful in predicted whether or not a player scored in the group stages of the Euros as we had initially hypothesized. Additionally, considering all scorers will allow us to also account for the players who scored a large amount of goals for their team during qualifiers but ended up scoring 1 less than another player on their team (excluding them from the top goalscorers table, when they could still be a potentially good candidate for scoring the group stages based on their performance in the qualifying stages). Another way we could increase size of our dataset is by collecting data from not just Euro 2012, like we've done here, but from Euros of past. Okay, so now that we've got the approach for handling the first obstacle, let's tackle the second one: which attributes we need (that our model will consider). For our purposes, we need attributes that are likely to influence how many goals a player scorers during the Euros. As we were considering goals scored in the Euro qualifiers, let's reuse that data and have our first two attributes be a player's goals per game ratio during qualifiers and their percentage of goals scored for their team as a means of indicated how in-form a player was coming into the tournament and measuring how integral the player is to the team they are on. Other factors which can affect a player's likelihood of scoring in the Euros is on the basis of how well their team is playing as whole coming into the tournament. Some ways we could measure this include a team's goals per game during qualifying (indicating how free-scoring of a team they are) and using the team's ELO ranking in the year leading up to the tournament. A final factor we should consider is how easy/difficult the group the team is placed in for the tournament is. If a team gets put in an easier group, then the chances of a player from that team scoring will consequently increase. As a measure of group difficulty, we can utilize the ELO rankings again, but this time taking the inverse of the sum of ELO rankings of all the other teams in a group, and using that as our measure (this way, the lower the sum ELO, the lesser the group difficulty, meaning the higher the value of the inverse of the sum will be and the higher chance of scoring).\n",

    "We will be using a Logistic Regression Model. The reasons why have decide to choose this model for our purposes is due to logistic regressions being one of the most common/popular models used when attempting to create a binary classifier (in our case we want our model to classify whether a given input falls into the category of \"will score in the Euro group stages\" or \"will not score in the Euro group stages\") and given that it is a model that tends to work fairly well even when you have a smaller amount of data (which is exactly what we have in our case). We will be using the Scikit Learn library's built-in logistic regression model (you can check out the documentation <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html\">here</a>) due to its quick, \"out-of-the-box\" usability, which will get us up an running in a heartbeat. If you want to learn more about the Logistic Regression Model and how you can use them when doing your own data science, you can check out the resources <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/binary-classification-and-logistic-regression-for-beginners-dd6213bf7162\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/understanding-logistic-regression-python\">here</a>, which should be more than enough to get you started. In order to test our model and prevent the model from overfitting our training data (and hence be biased), we will be using Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation. This technique involves basically shuffling our dataset into randomly and splitting it into k-groups. Then we will look at each combination of groups, and for each group, we will hold out it once as the test set and utilize the remaining k-1 groups as the dataset which will be used to train the model. We will then evaluate the model on the hold-out test set and repeat the process, using each group once as the hold-out test set. We will specifically be using a Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation, which means that during each split, each fold will have the same proportion of classifications (so in our case, each fold will have the same proportion of True to False classifications). We will once again be using Scikit Learn to integrate this feature (using their out-of-the-box Repeated Stratified K-Fold, documentation found <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RepeatedStratifiedKFold.html\">here</a>). You can check out more about K-Fold Cross Validation and Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation <a href=\"https://medium.com/@venkatasujit272/overview-of-cross-validation-3785d5414ece\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stratified-k-fold-cross-validation/\">here</a>. For each iteration, we also have to have a metric to evaluate how good the model did. In order to do this we will be using (you guessed it) yet another Scikit Learn feature, <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score.html\">cross_value_score</a>. We will score our model on the basis of accuracy. Alright now that we've talked about what type of model we will be using and how we are going to test and evaluate our model, let's get to generated our model...\n",

In order to account for this imbalance, one thing we can do is add class weights to our logistic regression model. Let's go ahead and keep our class weight for the 'True' classification (indicating the player did score during the Euros) as 1 and incrementally adjust the weight of the 'False' classification, and see which ratio gives us the highest mean accuracy. We can then use the model that performs the best as our final model fit with the specific weights that performed the best.\n",

    "    In our two sections (Predicting The Tournament Winner and The Search For Fantasy Gold), we utilized two different methods in order to gather and store our data in a pandas dataframe. In Section 1, we showed you how to read a csv file into a pandas dataframe, and in Section 2, we used BeautifulSoup to scrape the data needed. The two approaches yielded a similar process in regards to the structure of the pipeline, but a major difference is the amount of time spent in each phase of the pipeline. Specifically, in Section 1, having the data initially in a csv file allowed us to easily and quickly get our data into the format desired (a pandas dataframe). This led to us spending minimal time on the data accessing, management, and representation, and enabled us to spend the bulk of our time in the other phases of the data science pipeline (exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, etc.). On the other hand, Section 2 required a signficant amount of time to scrape the data from the various pages of html and get it into the ultimate pandas dataframe used during our exploration and analysis. This led to analysis itself requiring proportionally less time, with tools such as Scikit Learn enabling us to quickly create a predictive model to find the \"best\" fantasy assets.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size:16px\">\n",
    "    As you can see, there are benefits and drawbacks of each approach. When using csv files (or any another sort of readily formatted and accessible data), the data management and representation phase requires significantly less time, allowing you the opportunity to dedicate your energy and efforts into the exploration and analysis portions. The drawback is that you are only limited to the pre-made datasets that you can find on the internet, which can prevent you from doing analysis using specific metrics or statistics (which may be extremely valuable). On other hand, scraping html gives you that wider range of data, as sort of table, list, or even regular text becomes fair game. You now have the ability to acquire those metrics and statistics that you may not have had access too before. The obvious, and perhaps painstaking, drawback (as we personally experienced ourselves) is that scraping html on \"messy\" website is highly time and energy consuming. This will lead to you having significantly less time for actual analysis (especially when you have to conduct analysis within a specific time frame). Given these pros and cons, our recommendation is to go for readily accessible data (such as csv files) when you can. Especially if you can find a dataset with all the information you are looking for to conduct your analysis, utilizing those available datasets is likely the best option. In the few instances where you have scoured the internet for every possible dataset and couldn't find the data you were looking for (and the only place it happens to be on is Wikipedia), then there likely is no other option than going down the rabbit hole that is BeautifulSoup and web scraping. \n",
