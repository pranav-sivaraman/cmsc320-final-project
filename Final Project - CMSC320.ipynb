    "    The UEFA European Football Championship, also known as the Euros, is a tournament held by UEFA every four years which consists of countries in Europe. There are also similar competitions for other continents such as the CONCACAF Gold Cup which is held for North American international teams. Although there are many different continental competitions, the Euros are by far the most popular because the majority of the worlds best players play for European teams. Although this competition is called the 2020 Euros, it is being held in 2021 because of COVID. Currently the qualifiers for the tournment have already been played and the 24 teams that go into the tournament have already been decided. Later on you will see a list of these teams. The current reigning champions are Portugal.\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"font-size:16px\">\n",
    "    The format of the tournament starts off with a group stage where there are 6 groups of 4 teams each. During the group stage each team will play every other team twice, once at home and once away from home. Each team gets 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss. At the end of the group stage, the top 2 teams move on to the next round and play in a standard knockout style tournament.\n",

    "So first things first, if you are new to the realm of fantasy football don't worry. Here's the basics of how fantasy works... in most fantasy football formats (yes there are multiple fantasy games for the same sporting event, as you could imagine one simply wouldn't be enough for the fantasy community) you are given a certain amount of budget at the start of the season to build your squad. Using that budget, you pick a set of 15 or so players (a starting 11 plus bench players) from the entire selection of players available. Each player in the game is given a particular price tag, with the \"better\"/more high profile players costing more than other players. Once you have picked your initial team, you pick a starting 11 for each matchweek/gameweek, during which the players in your 11 rack up points based on how will they perform (in real life) during that week. Points are usually awarded for every goal scored, every assist, clean sheets, minutes played, saves (for goalkeepers), etc. Come the end of the season, the more total points you accumulate the higher up you are in the leaderboard (whether that's worldwide, or simply a mini league you and your colleagues at work/school started). Note that there are more involved aspects of fantasy such as weekly transfers, captaincy, chips like wildcard and benchboost, etc. but we are not going to dive into these aspects as they are not necessary to get you started (and in fact, have no effect on the area of focus for this guide, which will be the initial team selection)."

    "Okay, so now that you know the basics of fantasy, let's talk about how it relates to the Euros! As you might imagine, just as there are fantasy games for the annual football leagues played across the world (like the English Premier League, the German Bundesliga, the Italian Serie A, etc.), there are also fantasy games for singular tournaments such as the World Cup and the Euros (which take place every four years). Since the tournament duration is only a month or two, the fantasy game will only run for the duration of the tournament. In fantasy games involving international tournaments, the game is usually split into two phases. One phase for the group stages and one phase for the knockout rounds. In other words, you get to choose an initial team to play during the group stage portion of the tournament (where each team is guaranteed to play 3 games against the other teams in their group), and then get to select a completely new squad for the knockout rounds, choosing players from the teams that are still alive in the tournament.

    "In this guide, we will solely focus on selecting the \"best\" players for the group stages. This is due to the fact that the group stages are the first phase of the Euro Fantasy game, and more importantly, since all we know are the teams who have qualified for the tournament, we can't make selections for the knockout stages as there is always the possibility that the players we pick are on teams that do not advance to the knockout stages (and hence will earn no points). Additionally, we will not be focusing on finding budget value players (players that are underpriced in the game when compared to their points potential) and will instead be focusing on picking the \"best\" fantasy assets on the pure basis of their form and potential for scoring loads of points (regardless of how expensive they are). In other words, this guide will be our selection of who we think are going to be the players who score the most points overall, and therefore serving as the foundational set of players you can build your team around (you think of it as the core players who will make up the largest chunk of your budget, but consequently expected to produce the most fantasy returns). Our aim is that by the end of this section, you will not just have a set of fantasy players who will help you kill it in fantasy this Euros (whether it's your first time playing or hundredth) but also understand the process of data representation, exploration, and analysis used to produce these picks. That way, you won't just do well this year, but have the necessary skillset to conduct your own data science to find the best players for your fantasy team next time out (as we hope you'll keep playing!).

    "Whether you or a soccer fan or not, we all know one thing: attackers score goals. As you might imagine, this mantra is very relevant when thinking about what attackers to select for your fantasy team. No matter what version of a fantasy game you play, the idea that \"the more goals your attackers score the better of your fantasy team will be\" holds true. After all, goals are the bread and butter of attackers. So with this in mind, let's zoom our lens in on the topscorers of each team. More specifically, the topscorers for each team during Euro Qualifiers (you guessed it. it's the set of games teams had to play in order to qualify for the tournament). Our hypothesis is that the topscorers for each team during the qualifiers are more likely to score during the group stages of the actual tournament. Let's see if this is the case by taking a look at the Euro's of previous years, and see what percentage of top scorers actually ended up scoring at least 1 goal in the group stages of the actual tournament."
