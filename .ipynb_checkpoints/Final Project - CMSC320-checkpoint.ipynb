    "    The UEFA European Football Championship, also known as the Euros, is a tournament held by UEFA every four years in which selection of European countries compete. There are also similar competitions for other continents such as the CONCACAF Gold Cup which is held for North American international teams. Although there are many different continental competitions, the Euros are by far the most popular because the majority of the worlds best players play for European teams. Although this competition is called the 2020 Euros, it is being held in 2021 because of COVID. Currently the qualifiers for the tournment have already been played and the 24 teams that go into the tournament have already been decided. Later on you will see a list of these teams. The current reigning champions are Portugal.\n",

    "    The format of the tournament starts off with a group stage where there are 6 groups of 4 teams each. During the group stage each team will play every other team twice, once at home and once away from home. Each team gets 3 points for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for a loss. At the end of the group stage, the top 2 teams move on to the next round and play in a standard knockout style tournament.\n",

    "So first things first, if you are new to the realm of fantasy football don't worry. Here's the basics of how fantasy works... in most fantasy football formats (yes there are multiple fantasy games for the same sporting event, as you could imagine one simply wouldn't be enough for the fantasy community) you are given a certain amount of budget at the start of the season to build your squad. Using that budget, you pick a set of 15 or so players (a starting 11 plus bench players) from the entire selection of players available. Each player in the game is given a particular price tag, with the \"better\"/more high profile players costing more than other players. Once you have picked your initial team, you pick a starting 11 for each matchweek/gameweek, during which the players in your 11 rack up points based on how will they perform (in real life) during that week. Points are usually awarded for every goal scored, every assist, clean sheets, minutes played, saves (for goalkeepers), etc. Come the end of the season, the more total points you accumulate the higher up you are in the leaderboard (whether that's worldwide, or simply a mini league you and your colleagues at work/school started). Note that there are more involved aspects of fantasy such as weekly transfers, captaincy, chips like wildcard and benchboost, etc. but we are not going to dive into these aspects as they are not necessary to get you started (and in fact, have no effect on the area of focus for this guide, which will be the initial team selection)."

    "Okay, so now that you know the basics of fantasy, let's talk about how it relates to the Euros! As you might imagine, just as there are fantasy games for the annual football leagues played across the world (like the English Premier League, the German Bundesliga, the Italian Serie A, etc.), there are also fantasy games for singular tournaments such as the World Cup and the Euros (which take place every four years). Since the tournament duration is only a month or two, the fantasy game will only run for the duration of the tournament. In fantasy games involving international tournaments, the game is usually split into two phases. One phase for the group stages and one phase for the knockout rounds. In other words, you get to choose an initial team to play during the group stage portion of the tournament (where each team is guaranteed to play 3 games against the other teams in their group), and then get to select a completely new squad for the knockout rounds, choosing players from the teams that are still alive in the tournament.

    "In this guide, we will solely focus on selecting the \"best\" players for the group stages. This is due to the fact that the group stages are the first phase of the Euro Fantasy game, and more importantly, since all we know are the teams who have qualified for the tournament, we can't make selections for the knockout stages as there is always the possibility that the players we pick are on teams that do not advance to the knockout stages (and hence will earn no points). Additionally, we will not be focusing on finding budget value players (players that are underpriced in the game when compared to their points potential) and will instead be focusing on picking the \"best\" fantasy assets on the pure basis of their form and potential for scoring loads of points (regardless of how expensive they are). In other words, this guide will be our selection of who we think are going to be the players who score the most points overall, and therefore serving as the foundational set of players you can build your team around (you think of it as the core players who will make up the largest chunk of your budget, but consequently expected to produce the most fantasy returns). Our aim is that by the end of this section, you will not just have a set of fantasy players who will help you kill it in fantasy this Euros (whether it's your first time playing or hundredth) but also understand the process of data representation, exploration, and analysis used to produce these picks. That way, you won't just do well this year, but have the necessary skillset to conduct your own data science to find the best players for your fantasy team next time out (as we hope you'll keep playing!).

No matter what version of a fantasy game you play, the idea that \"the more goals your attackers score the better of your fantasy team will be\" holds true. After all, goals are the bread and butter of attackers. So with this in mind, let's zoom our lens in on the topscorers of each team. More specifically, the topscorers for each team during Euro Qualifiers (you guessed it. it's the set of games teams had to play in order to qualify for the tournament). Our hypothesis is that the topscorers for each team during the qualifiers are more likely to score during the group stages of the actual tournament. Let's see if this is the case by taking a look at the Euro's of previous years, and see what percentage of top scorers actually ended up scoring at least 1 goal in the group stages of the actual tournament."

Though the increase was not quite as high as we would have liked to see and there still is the possibility that it was due to chance (as we are dealing with a relatively small size, so filtering are data even more could yield misleading results), we can still explore this possibility and see if there is some set of parameters we can adjust to create a threshold of requirements that if a player meets, makes them likely to score during the actual Euros."

    "Let's try a create model that can find this threshold of parameters that can best predict based on a player's performance in the qualifiers whether or not they will score at least one goal in the group stages. There are two things that we must do before we begin our process of creating the model. Number one, we need to gather a larger amount of data (because currently our sample size of topscorers is too small) so that we can feel comfortable collecting a model that will actually be a good predictor of future Euros. One immediate way we can expand our dataset size is by considering all the scorers in the qualifiers, instead of just the topscorers. From the previous analysis conducted, we see that limiting our scope to just top goalscorers was not as effective and successful in predicted whether or not a player scored in the group stages of the Euros as we had initially hypothesized. Additionally, considering all scorers will allow us to also account for the players who scored a large amount of goals for their team during qualifiers but ended up scoring 1 less than another player on their team (excluding them from the top goalscorers table, when they could still be a potentially good candidate for scoring the group stages based on their performance in the qualifying stages). Another way we could increase size of our dataset is by collecting data from not just Euro 2012, like we've done here, but from Euros of past. Okay, so now that we've got the approach for handling the first obstacle, let's tackle the second one: which parameters we need. For our purposes, we need parameters that are likely to influence how many goals a player scorers during the Euros. As we were considering goals scored in the Euro qualifiers, let's reuse that data and have our first two parameters be a player's goals per game ratio during qualifiers and their percentage of goals scored for their team as a means of indicated how in-form a player was coming into the tournament and measuring how integral the player is to the team they are on. Other factors which can affect a player's likelihood of scoring in the Euros is on the basis of how well their team is playing as whole coming into the tournament. Some ways we could measure this include a team's goals per game during qualifying (indicating how free-scoring of a team they are) and using the team's ELO ranking in the year leading up to the tournament. A final factor we should consider is how easy/difficult the group the team is placed in for the tournament is. If a team gets put in an easier group, then the chances of a player from that team scoring will consequently increase. As a measure of group difficulty, we can utilize the ELO rankings again, but this time taking the inverse of the sum of ELO rankings of all the other teams in a group, and using that as our measure (this way, the lower the sum ELO, the lesser the group difficulty, meaning the higher the value of the inverse of the sum will be and the higher chance of scoring)."

    "I thing we must consider when creating our model is the unbalanced nature of the classifications... specifically the overwhelming percentage of our training data were classified as false (which make sense as most players don't score during the Euros). In order to account for this imbalance, one thing we can do is add class weights to our logistic regression model. Let's go ahead and keep our class weight for the 'True' classification (indicating the player did score during the Euros) and incrementally adjust the weight of the 'False' classification, and seeing which ratio gives us the highest mean accuracy. We can then use the model fit with those weights."
